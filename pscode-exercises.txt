// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

 *Number Input = N*

If N % 2 then Print Even. 

If N % 2 is False Print Odd.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
Input N1,N2,N3,N4,N5

Average = Sum of N1+N2+N3+N4+N5 % 5

*Smallest- Min = N1* 

Is N2<Min if true Print Smallest if False Min is Unchanged.

Run Iteration N3-N5.

If Min is unchanged N1 is min.

If Min is changed then Print New Min.

*Largest - Max= N5*

Is N4>Max If true Print Max if False Max is unchanged. 

Run Iteration N3-N1.

If Max is unchanged N5 is Max.

If Max is changed Print new Max.

Average=3

Minimum= N1

Maximum =N5
